## Check Validations
This cruid has a system of validations client and server side.
For the fields Name and Surname the form controls only client side if the fields exceed the length , while , for the age field , the form checks
if the value is in a range between 18 and 99.
The mail field is checked both client and server side , The validations client side affect only the length and if there is the `@` char in the value , instead , 
the validations server regard the validity of the mail.

The form does not allow the insert of a new user with the same mail.
